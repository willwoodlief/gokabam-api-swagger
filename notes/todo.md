##Notes##

###todo###
* need to make this a ror project (5)
* have the ymal files do translation keys for all names and descriptions
* have a route to merge all yaml files and display the output
* get into node swagger-ui code to auto build html2 by calling node code from ruby
* once html2 docs are built then substitute all description links with markdown rendered html
* except in code blocks then put in just first paragraph as text
* render html2 docs to file or display depending on call
* have this callable from the command line and build for all languages
* have git hook on push to push to swaggerhub the single file using swaggerhub api

###runs###
